This python code is used for unwrapping InSAR interferogram based on a pre-selected spare points network. User needs to have SNAPHU installed because the unwrapping kernel will be still SNAPHU. The code does a masking on each interferogram based on the pre-defined mask file. Then it interpolates the interferograms using nearest-neighbor algorithm. The unwrapped interferogram is sent to SNAPHU after interpolation. Another making step will be implemented after unwrapping to take out those points generated by nearest-neighbor interpolation. 

User needs to setup a parameter list file specifying parameters like the working path, string character of interferogram(e.g. if you want to unwrap 4rlks interferogram), SNAPHU options and so on. An example of the parameter file is included in the package. Now the code supports roipac and NSBAS formats. User can easily extend to a new format. The code also requires a utilities library which has been included in the package.

Any question about using this code, please contact Wenliang Zhao at "zhaowenliangpolyu@gmail.com"
